CrackerPop
==========
There are three files in this repo. 

One is JavaScript file which is a simple number generator from 1 to 100 with numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 labeled CrackerPop, those divisible by 3 Cracker, those divisible by 5 Pop and the rest as numbers.

The second is an R(CrackerPop.R) file that does the same thing as the one in JS

The third file (CrackerPopFunction.R) is also an R file that gives a user the oppotunity to determine if the number given is divisible by either 3 or 5 or both. This file contains a function unlike the other two which generate the numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3, 5 or both.

*This was part of my learning process in JS and R
