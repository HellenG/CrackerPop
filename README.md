CrackerPop
==========
There are three files in this repo. 

One is a JavaScript file which is basically a simple number generator from 1 to 100 with numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 labelled "CrackerPop", those divisible by 3 "Cracker", those divisible by 5 "Pop" and the rest as numbers.

The second is an R file ("CrackerPop.R") that does the same thing as the one in JS. Only difference is that R gives it's output in a vector form.

The third file ("CrackerPopFunction.R") is also an R file that gives a user the oppotunity to determine if the number given is divisible by either 3, 5 or both. This file contains a function unlike the other two which generate the numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3, 5 or both.

*This was part of my learning process in JS(2014) and R(2015). Lessons here are on using conditional statements, use of modulo, creation of a function(R), and using for loops.
